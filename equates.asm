; Each I/O channel uses an IOCB (I/O Control Block) — a fixed block
; of memory containing command, device, buffer address, and aux bytes.
; We use IOCB6 (base address $0360) for graphics.
; X register = $60 tells CIOV which IOCB to use (IOCB6).
; =====================================================================

; After CIO opens GR.8, the OS stores the address of screen RAM

; On our 800XL PAL system screen RAM ends up at $B060.

; Attract mode constants
; The Atari OS has an attract mode that kicks in after inactivity
; to prevent screen burn-in. It does this by desaturating all colors
; making everything appear as shades of grey/blue.
; We must continuously reset these in our main loop to keep colors!
; =====================================================================
